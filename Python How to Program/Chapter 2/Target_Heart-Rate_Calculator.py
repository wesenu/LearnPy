# While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor 
# to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range. 
# formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 
# 220 minus your age in years.
# Your target heart rate is 50â€“85% of your maximum heart rate.
# Ask users their age and print the details
