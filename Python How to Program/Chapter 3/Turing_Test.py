# Create a script that plays the part of the independent computer, giving its user a simple medical diagnosis. 
# The script should prompt the user with 'What is your problem?'
# When the user answers and presses Enter, the script should simply ignore the userâ€™s input,
# then prompt the user again with 'Have you had this problem before (yes or no)?' 
# If the user enters 'yes', print 'Well, you have it again.' 
# If the user answers 'no', print 'Well, you have it now.'
